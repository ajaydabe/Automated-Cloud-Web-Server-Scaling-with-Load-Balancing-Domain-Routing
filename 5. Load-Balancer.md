### Now, we are creating Load Balancer to distribute traffic amaong the instances

Follow the below given steps to create Load Balancer

#### Step 1 :-

Go to **EC2 ==> Load Balancers ==> Create Load Balancer**

#### Step 2 :-

Select the required Load Balancer type based on our use cases. Here we selected **Application Load Balancer**.

#### Step 3 :-

In Basic Configuration, give the appropriate name to your Load balancer

Select Internet-facing Scheme as our traffic is coming from internet.

Select the IP address type as IPv4 as our subnet using IPv4 addresses

#### Step 6 :-

In **Listener and Routing** section, select appropriate protocol, port number and our Target Group on which we are sending traffic

#### Step 7 :-

Click on **Create Load Balancer** option

Our Load Balancer is got created now and ready to serve traffic using the DNS name

Copy and paste this DNS Name on browser and you will see the apache or nginx page at first.

Refresh the page and you can see that the load balancer now distributed the traffic to the nginx page as shown below.

That means, we set up Load Balancer correctly as it is sending traffic to our servers using Round-Robin method.
