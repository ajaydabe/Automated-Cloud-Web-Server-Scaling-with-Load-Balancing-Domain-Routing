# High-Availability-Web-Architecture-with-Load-Balancing-Domain-Routing

This project implements an auto-scaling cloud infrastructure for web servers, utilizing a load balancer for traffic distribution and seamless domain routing to ensure high availability and performance.

## Benefits:

### High Availability:

The project ensures web servers are always available by automatically scaling resources up during peak traffic.

This eliminates downtime due to overloaded servers, keeping your website or application accessible to users.

### Scalability and Elasticity:

The cloud infrastructure can automatically adjust its capacity based on real-time traffic demands.

This allows you to handle sudden surges in traffic without performance degradation and efficiently manage resources during low traffic periods.

### Improved Performance:

By automatically scaling resources, the project ensures web servers have sufficient processing power to handle user requests efficiently.

This leads to faster page load times and a better user experience.

### Cost Optimization:

You only pay for the resources you use.

During low traffic periods, the cloud infrastructure can scale down, reducing cloud compute costs.

### Simplified Management:

Auto-scaling automates the process of adding or removing servers, freeing up IT staff to focus on other critical tasks.
