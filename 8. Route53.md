We need to create a Record with subdomain to route traffic to load balancer DNS.

For that, go to created **Hosted Zone (project2.com) ==> Records ==> Create Record**

Give the record name as **aws** (keep it as you want) and select **Alias**

In the **Route traffic to**, from drop down menu select below options

Endpoint as **Alias to Application and Classic Load Balancer**

Region as **US East (N. Virginia)** and select our load balancer

Select Routing Policy as **Simple Routing** and click on **Create Records**

As you can see, our record is created and subdomain is assigned to it.
